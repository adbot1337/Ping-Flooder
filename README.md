Ping flooding is considered a form of network attack and may be illegal or against network usage policies in many contexts. (USE AT OWN RISK.)

Misuse of such scripts can result in legal consequences and network restrictions. (I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DO NOT USE.)

This script lacks error handling and proper safeguards, making it potentially hazardous to use. (I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, EITHER TO YOUR OR OF YOUR TARGET, YOU ASSUME ALL ACCOUNTABILITY REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAVE YOU.)

I highly doubt this 2 decade old method of attack will do anything in the modern age, however thought i'd share a relic of the days of old, back in the gears of war 3 days or the halo reach days, black ops 2 etc...

had the orignal scirpt sitting on a old dell latitude laptop, it's been touched up by chatgpt as well as myself, again use at your OWN RISK, YOU ARE ACCOUNTABLE for ANY DAMAGES done to either yourself or others, do NOT use this, but if you do... use for educational purposes only! 

ENJOY!
