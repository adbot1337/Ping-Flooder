Ping flooding is considered a form of network attack and may be illegal or against network usage policies in many contexts. (use at own risk.)
Misuse of such scripts can result in legal consequences and network restrictions. (I highly suggest you do not use.)
This script lacks error handling and proper safeguards, making it potentially hazardous to use. (I am not responsible for any damages, either to your equipment or of your target, you assume all accountability regardless of what have you.)

The effectiveness of ping flooding as a DoS technique has decreased over time due to several factors:

Rate Limiting: Many modern network devices and operating systems implement rate limiting and ICMP rate control mechanisms to mitigate the impact of ping flooding attacks. This means that they can intelligently handle and prioritize ICMP traffic to prevent network saturation.

Firewalls and Filtering: Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) often have specific rules and filters in place to detect and block ICMP flooding attempts. They can recognize patterns associated with ping flooding and drop or throttle ICMP traffic accordingly.

Internet Service Provider (ISP) Protections: ISPs implement various network protections and traffic shaping mechanisms to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks, including ICMP flooding. They may filter or limit excessive ICMP traffic at their network edge.
Improvements in Network Infrastructure: Advances in network hardware and infrastructure have led to higher capacity and better traffic management, making it more difficult to saturate a network solely with ICMP packets.

Alternative Attack Methods: As defenses against ICMP flooding have improved, attackers have shifted towards other types of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks that can exploit different vulnerabilities or leverage a larger number of compromised devices (botnets) to generate higher volumes of traffic.

overall i highly doubt this 2 decade old method of attack will do anything in the modern age, however thought i'd share a relic of the days of old, back in the gears of war 3 days or the halo reach days, black ops 2 etc...

had the orignal scirpt sitting on a old dell latitude laptop, it's been touched up by chatgpt, again use at your own risk, you are accountable for any damages done to either yourself or others, do not use this, but if you do use for educational purposes only! 

ENJOY!
